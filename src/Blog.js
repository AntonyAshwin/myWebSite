/>   One of those games that i woudn't fitgirl repack. stars Norman Reedus as Sam Porter, a deliver guy tasked to reconnect isolated cities.
        vrushank says this is a walking simulator. to me, its fucking unique. I havent played anything like this before.

        The story is highly philosophical, very cryptic, and original. The apocalyptic futuristic world is haunted by ghost like thing called BTs and timefall - rain which ages stuff when the rain drops 
        get in contact with the stuff. its got some really deep story plots (david lynch stuff).

        Gameplay mechanics - 85% of the game is delivering stuff from one point to another. it sounds boring - its not. there are beautiful biomes, weight balancing, climbing mountains,
        crossing rivers, avoiding these BTs, and managing resource. also its got this async multiplayer like online players can leave their resouces for you. there is combat and stealth,
        but i dont think Kojima's focus was on them - probably added cuz of metalgear.

        Graphics - honestly, not that great, i was on an AMD Ryzen 5, RX 570 4GB, 16GB RAM. I could in 1920x1080 with all high, but the graphics still looked shit. maybe i have the Anisotropic low.
        and sharpness high. the render distance was amazing, though. Weather effects and physics are amazing - well polished. especially in the snow and rocky terrain. Characters are photo realistic. 

        Music - mostly by Low Roar - very melancholic. environment sound is amazing - especially the rain, thunder, snow storms and the BT detector sounds. Voice acting are by the actors themselves. + point

        Bugs and shit - didnt notice much, there are some weird jigs here and there when riding a motorcycle across rough terrain, also see them rarely when on foot - nothing major though. game is well
        optimized. 
        
        Story - Huge story with very deep references and tons of terminologies, miss one and you're gonna have to goolge it - else you'd miss the next thing and end up like watching a david lynch movie. I think its 
        got a 45 hours or something out of which lot of it is cinematics - and they are kinda the core element of this game. guys who loves movies will definetly love this game. if you are someone
        who likes to skip cinematics and jump to gameplay - maybe not for you, go play rocket league or some shit.

        Grind - I hate grinds, i just dont have the time for it, there is a bit of grind in the game for better tools and gears but honestly, you can beat the game without that too. optional quests 
        are mostly just deliveries for more resources. you can skip them - i dont think you'll miss much (maybe an easter egg or 2)

        Verdict - a 9/10 for me, must play for guys who love narrative-heavy.a very polarized experience - maybe not for everyone but yeah if it clicks you, its unforgettable. requires a lot of patience with story telling and gameplay
        that is kinda medeative and sometimes very cryptic.

/>  I was dropping my brother at the airport, and we were talking about a bunch of things. Out of everything, we discussed Steve Winwood’s “Can’t Find My Way Home” - not the original by Blind Faith, but a live version with Eric Clapton. I loved the intro and the two other solos he played in it.

After dropping him off, I was driving back home. The sky was orange just as I got past the toll plaza, and I had this song on loop. I could feel the breeze outside, but I had my AC on. It was beautiful, there was nothing to worry about, everything felt right. I hadn’t felt like that in a really long time. There was a lot of shit going on in 2024 too, but in that moment, everything was perfect. Nothing to worry about, it just felt so fucking good. I’ve never gotten that feeling again.</>

  it was released in 2003 by Rockstar Games. probably a banger at that time. 
    an alltime favourite of many, an alltime nostalgia for a lot. I originally played this in 2009 but I never got to beat it, I was maybe 8 or something. I only started playing it now after watching a lot of scorsese movies and finally scarface.
    main plot is: Tommy Vercetti comes to VC for a drug deal, but shit goes south and he needs to sort this shit. it’s an open world game, probably the most popular one at that time, set in vice city, giving a Miami inspired 80s vibe. the last game was very dark and gritty, so I guess rockstar decided to make this a full neon, vibrant,
    super high contrast world. amazing open world for its time, missions were not boring (god helped in the RC copter mission), awesome vehicles, cool animations. not much freedom in choosing the style to complete a mission,
    but that’s fine after all, it was 2003. a lot of improvements over GTA 3, amazing protagonist, I didn’t know it was Ray Liotta. in fact, I didn’t know who Ray Liotta was till I started watching scorsese’s stuff. graphics are good for its time, world is small but still good.
    not much to do once the game is complete, my favourite was the music - especially Flash FM, omg it’s the best. overall a 10/10.

I decided to leave office a bit late today, typing this while waiting for my deployment to finish. It’s odd, I used to hate staying late at my old company. Back then, I’d just stare at the clock, waiting for it to hit 7 so I could punch out. Now I didn’t even look at the time, but I know it’s pretty late and I should probably head home.

is this something new ? commiting in a static file directly on the repo and calling it a blog post. no db, no server code, no session. sounds cool

Colosseum
was excited to see this, I played a lot of ACBH, when I saw from a bit far it looked smaller, when I went closer it looked bigger, also could see the viewpoint that was in ACBH - but the place was not very crowded and also it was a bit rainy. there was tram service too and a UG metro. the place is not very modern but a classic Europe town. also liked the arch of constantine - exactly how it was in acbh
i walked across old rome while chatgpting acbh references - bunch of old buildings.
i went back to the motel, 
dinner -  apple, chocolate bar.

      i'm heading to st paul's church.
      on the way i got breakfast,
 croissant, loaf of bread, jam

, cheese, honey, scrambled eggs, pineapple juice. 

i went to saint paul’s church. on the way before reaching, i saw aqueduct - exactly how it was in acbh, i love the side hustle in acbh to complete the building of aqueduct - the original is well in pieces

reached, nothing special there was a mass for the ministry i think ministry of finance guys were there and lot of army dudes 2 starred - green coats

i overheard the guide talk about INRI board and the nail kept omly 800m across
not sure if i’m believing it cuz something so important wouldn’t be kept so openly, i feel probably the original is hidden somewhere.
i reached.
also there was a photo of the shroud that was kept on Jesus before putting him in the tomb, 

then headed to Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major - papa francis tomb - very simple plane white, jesus’s cradle’s hays were preserved there
i saw tiber island (acbh assassin hq) and casttelo angelo 
for lunch,  i ordered a mango juice for €2

vatican museum - italian paintings and sculptures
sistine Chappel - beautiful but the security kept asking me to move
St peter’s basilica i saw where ezio ran with the eden, also saw the entrance of the epic rodrigo ezio fight.

for dinner
i  took a 100 bill on hopes that the restaurant guy will have change. I asked what he can recommend and he said carbonara, pork, cheese and what not, not sure. he asked if i should get something to drink, i told i’ll wait

after this meal, he recommended an italian beer
