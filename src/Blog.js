        <h3>Euphemism - i recently learnt what this means </h3>
        <p>A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression used in place of something that might be harsh, unpleasant, embarrassing, or blunt.</p>
        When Euphemism is BAD in Agile: <br></br>
It hides real problems

Saying “We had a few delays” instead of “We underestimated our capacity by 50%” kills transparency.

It slows feedback loops

Agile relies on fast, honest iteration. Euphemisms delay real conversations.

It dilutes retrospectives

A retro full of “some communication gaps” instead of “the design was never explained” leads to no improvement.

It creates false alignment

Everyone nods, but no one really knows what went wrong.

Idk just my thoughts. <br></br><br></br>

Maybe i should plug this to an sql server and make an actual blog out of it where others can reply. <br></br>
